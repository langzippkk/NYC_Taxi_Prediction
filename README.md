# NYC_Taxi_Prediction
In this project, I used the taxi data from 2016 in NYC, and build a model to predict the travel duration 
for each trip.
Specificly, we 
	Gathered taxi data from website and used BigQuery to clean data and generated new features with SQL.
	Attached creative features to increase model performance including stock prices, and weather data.
	Trained models with Decision Tree, Back-propagation Neural Network XGBoost models with cross-validation and used grid search for tuning parameters.
	Selected XGBoost model with mean squared log error of 0.33.
